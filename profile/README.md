**Were you looking for the V2X simulation and emulation framework ms-van3t?**

ms-van3t has now been integrated into the more extensive V2X framework **VaN3Twin**, that includes the **full ms-van3t**, just under a new name, with the addition of new functionalities like the integration with a full-fledged ray-tracer!
If you are looking for ms-van3t, you will find it under the new name VaN3Twin, and with new functionalities like the integration with the Sionna ray-tracer.

Together with the introduction of **VaN3Twin**, the repository has been moved to **DriveX-devs**, an organization that collects our open source projects for vehicular communications, which we have developed over the years and which are not only related to simulations, but also to real-world vehicular networks.

You can find the new *ms-van3t*, **VaN3Twin**, here: [https://github.com/DriveX-devs/VaN3Twin](https://github.com/DriveX-devs/VaN3Twin)
